    <full-instructions header="Bounding Box Instructions" >
      <p>Use the bounding box tool to draw boxes around the requested target of interest:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Draw a rectangle using your mouse over each instance of the target.</li>
        <li>Make sure the box does not cut into the target, leave a 2 - 3 pixel margin</li>
        <li>
          When targets are overlapping, draw a box around each object,
          include all contiguous parts of the target in the box.
          Do not include parts that are completely overlapped by another object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not include parts of the target that cannot be seen,
          even though you think you can interpolate the whole shape of the target.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid shadows, they're not considered as a part of the target.</li>
        <li>If the target goes off the screen, label up to the edge of the image.</li>
      </ol>
