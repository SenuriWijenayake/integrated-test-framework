                    <p>You have been contacted via the Amazon MTurk platform to invite you to participate in our study investigating the quality of crowdworkers contributions.
                        Participation will involve the completion of a set of cognitive tests followed by typical crowdsourcing tasks on selected topics (item recognition, sentiment analysis, proofreading). No identifying information will be collected as part of our research data, and while participation will involve the recording of your worker ID, this will be removed from the data immediately after download. We will therefore not be able to identify your particular responses in our data.
                        We do not anticipate any risks to you from participation. You are expected to spend around 30 minutes and will receive the agreed upon value of $5 (USD) for the completion of the HIT. Participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw from further participation at any stage up to the submission of your data. However, you will not receive any payment if you decide to abandon the task before completion. Submission of the final results will be taken as an indication of your consent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you would like more information about the project, please contact the researchers using the Amazon's communication functionality.
