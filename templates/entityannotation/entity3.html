  text="Dutch forward Reggie Blinker had his indefinite suspension lifted by FIFA on Friday and was set to make his Sheffield Wednesday comeback against Liverpool on Saturday.

Blinker missed his club's last two games after FIFA slapped a worldwide ban on him for appearing to sign contracts for both Wednesday and Udinese while he was playing for Feyenoord.

FIFA's players' status committee, meeting in Barcelona, decided that although the Udinese document was basically valid, it could not be legally protected.

The committee said the Italian club had violated regulations by failing to inform Feyenoord, with whom the player was under contract. Blinker was fined 75,000 Swiss francs ($ 57,600) for failing to inform the English club of his previous commitment to Udinese.
