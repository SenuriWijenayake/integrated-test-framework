  text="British Prime Minister John Major's office said on Friday that rebel Conservative MP Sir John Gorst had not 'resigned the whip' (quit the parliamentary party) and the government still had a majority in the 651-seat parliament.
'He (Gorst) is reserving the right not to cooperate, but he has not resigned the whip. The government still has a majority,' a spokesman from Major's office in Downing Street said.

Gorst's office said later the MP would not feel himself obliged to vote with the government. He said at one point during a press conference : 'I have seen my whip (party manager) for next week which, of course, doesn't mean very much to me now.'
Before Gorst's statement, Major had a one-seat majority in the 651-seat House of Commons lower house of parliament. In his formal statement, Gorst said : 'I am today withdrawing my cooperation from the government and shall not treat the 'whip' as either a summons to attend the House of Commons or as placing me under any obligation to vote as advised.'
