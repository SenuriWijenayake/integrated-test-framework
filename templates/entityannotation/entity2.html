  text="Italy recalled Marcello Cuttitta on Friday for their friendly against Scotland at Murrayfield more than a year after the 30-year-old wing announced he was retiring following differences over selection.

Cuttitta, who trainer George Coste said was certain to play on Saturday week, was named in a 21-man squad lacking only two of the team beaten 54-21 by England at Twickenham last month.

Stefano Bordon is out through illness and Coste said he had dropped back row Corrado Covi, who had been recalled for the England game after five years out of the national team.

Cuttitta announced his retirement after the 1995 World Cup, where he took issue with being dropped from the Italy side that faced England in the pool stages.

Coste said he had approached the player two months ago about a comeback. 'He ended the World Cup on the wrong note' Coste said. 'I thought it would be useful to have him back and he said he would be available. I think now is the right time for him to return.'
Squad : Javier Pertile, Paolo Vaccari, Marcello Cuttitta, Ivan Francescato, Leandro Manteri, Diego Dominguez, Francesco Mazzariol, Alessandro Troncon, Orazio Arancio, Andrea Sgorlon, Massimo Giovanelli, Carlo Checchinato, Walter Cristofoletto, Franco Properzi Curti, Carlo Orlandi, Massimo Cuttitta, Giambatista Croci, Gianluca Guidi, Nicola Mazzucato, Alessandro Moscardi, Andrea Castellani."
