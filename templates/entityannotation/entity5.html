  text="Centre Jason Little will miss Australia's end-of-tour fixture against the Barbarians at Twickenham on Saturday.

Little has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow Queenslander Daniel Herbert. Owen Finegan has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend's test against Wales and retains his place in the back-row ahead of Daniel Manu.

The Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David Campese with a fitting send-off in his final match in Australian colours.

The Wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic.
